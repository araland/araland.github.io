title: From Developer to CTO - The Shift You Never See Coming
description: From coffee-fueled coding marathons to steering the ship as a CTO, this piece dives into the twists and turns of the journey. Along the way, it spills the tea on blockchain's not-so-perfect realities and the juggling act CTOs perform to keep everything running smoothly (and ideally, without fires).

There was a time when your biggest concern was making your code compile before lunch. Back then, you were the master of your IDE, juggling pull requests like a circus performer with a coffee IV. Fast forward a few years, and here you are—a CTO. The view is different from up here.

## The Developer Mindset

As a developer, life had its challenges, but they were your challenges. Debugging, refactoring, optimizing—these were puzzles you could solve with logic, patience, and maybe a Stack Overflow post or two. You knew where you stood because your work was measured in commits, PRs, and the sweet satisfaction of a passing CI/CD pipeline.

You could afford to have opinions like:

>"Why can’t management just let us refactor this?"

>"Deadlines are so arbitrary. Let’s focus on quality."

>"Why are meetings even a thing?"

## The CTO Perspective

And then it happened. You became "management." Suddenly, the concerns you once dismissed as distractions are your daily bread. Now, you’re not just responsible for the code—you’re responsible for the people writing it, the budget funding it, and the roadmap guiding it.

Here’s what you learn quickly:

> Code Is the Easy Part

You’re not optimizing functions; you’re optimizing teams. Communication patterns, motivation, and even office politics are now part of your skill set.

> Deadlines Are Not Arbitrary

They’re tied to funding, partnerships, and opportunities you can’t afford to miss. Suddenly, the phrase "MVP" feels like a lifeline, not a compromise.

> Refactors Are a Luxury

Every refactor is an opportunity cost. That legacy codebase you used to curse? Now it’s your responsibility to keep it running while deciding if a rewrite is worth the risk.

> Meetings Have a Purpose (Mostly)

Sure, not all meetings are great, but alignment doesn’t happen by osmosis. Now you’re the one ensuring the right people are in the room and the agenda stays on track.

## The Hardest Lesson

The transition isn’t just about gaining responsibilities; it’s about letting go. You’ll miss the deep focus of coding. You’ll envy the developers who can finish a feature and call it a day. As a CTO, your work is never "done." There’s always another fire to put out, another decision to make, another risk to weigh.

## Why It’s Worth It

And yet, there’s something incredibly rewarding about this role. Watching your team grow, seeing your product thrive, knowing that your decisions shape the future—it’s a different kind of satisfaction. It’s not about the code anymore; it’s about the impact.
