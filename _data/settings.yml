  about_description: |
    I’ve worn many hats in my career—from Software Engineer to Backend Developer, DevOps Specialist, CTO, and even CEO. Along the way, I’ve faced countless challenges, navigated tough decisions, and learned from my fair share of mistakes.
    
    This blog is my space to share the lessons I’ve gained, the stories that shaped me, and the insights I hope will inspire and guide others in their own journeys. Whether you’re just starting out or already leading the charge, I believe we all grow through shared experience.
